This example requires that you have the MTP library working.

The library is included in a separate .zip file.  Move the library to the Libraries folder in your Arduino sketch folder.  You will also have to substitute the boards.txt file here for 

Arduino-1.8.13/hardware/teensy/avr/boards.txt.

You will also have to substitute the usb_desc.h file here for

Arduino-1.8.13/hardware/teensy/avr/cores/teensy4/usb_desc.h.

These steps will remain necessary until the MTP responder is fully integrated into TeensyDuino.
